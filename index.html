    <P> Dear [Aleiah],

I’ve been thinking a lot about everything, and I realized that I owe you a sincere apology.

First, I’m sorry for the way I handled things. Looking back, I can see how my actions, or even my silence at times, may have hurt you. That was never my intention, but I understand now that intentions do not erase impact. If I made you feel unappreciated, unheard, or alone in any way, I am truly sorry.

I also want to apologize if I became too focused on my own feelings and failed to see yours. Sometimes I get caught up in what I am going through and forget that relationships are about balance, about showing up for each other equally. You deserved more patience, more reassurance, and more effort from me.

Please know that you matter to me. What we have, or had, is important, and I do not take it lightly. I have taken time to reflect, and I see the areas where I need to grow. This is not just an apology because I feel bad. It is an apology because I genuinely want to do better.

I cannot change what has already happened, but I can promise to be more mindful, more present, and more open moving forward. I want to communicate better. I want to listen more. I want to show up in a way that feels safe and consistent for both of us.

Thank you for the patience you have given me, even when I did not fully deserve it. And thank you for being honest about how you felt. That honesty means more than you probably know.

No matter what happens next, I hope you can feel the sincerity in this. You are important to me, and I am truly sorry.

With all my heart,
[Alexander, your baby]

With all my heart,
[Alexander, your baby]

Dear [Aleiah],

I’ve been thinking a lot about everything, and I realized that I owe you a sincere apology.

First, I’m sorry for the way I handled things. Looking back, I can see how my actions, or even my silence at times, may have hurt you. That was never my intention, but I understand now that intentions do not erase impact. If I made you feel unappreciated, unheard, or alone in any way, I am truly sorry.

I also want to apologize if I became too focused on my own feelings and failed to see yours. Sometimes I get caught up in what I am going through and forget that relationships are about balance, about showing up for each other equally. You deserved more patience, more reassurance, and more effort from me.

Please know that you matter to me. What we have, or had, is important, and I do not take it lightly. I have taken time to reflect, and I see the areas where I need to grow. This is not just an apology because I feel bad. It is an apology because I genuinely want to do better.

I cannot change what has already happened, but I can promise to be more mindful, more present, and more open moving forward. I want to communicate better. I want to listen more. I want to show up in a way that feels safe and consistent for both of us.

Thank you for the patience you have given me, even when I did not fully deserve it. And thank you for being honest about how you felt. That honesty means more than you probably know.

No matter what happens next, I hope you can feel the sincerity in this. You are important to me, and I am truly sorry.

With all my heart,
[Alexander, your baby]
